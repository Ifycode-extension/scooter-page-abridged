# Scooter Page Abridged
My solution for problematic arrows, created from task given by GADS2020 mentor [Tolufolorunsho](https://twitter.com/Developer_Tolu) in the Google Africa Developer scholarship 2020 program. Repo created for reference purpose and is sample for anyone (in GADS2020 mobile specialist track) finding making the arrows responsive hard. Not design oriented, only did for 2 sections, did not include any distractions like photos, colorful design e.t.c, so that it's easier to see the arrows code.
